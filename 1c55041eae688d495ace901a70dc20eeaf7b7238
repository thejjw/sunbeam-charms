      "message": "I think in this case, what I\u0027m referring to is that certificates are likely needed to be provided inside the cinder-volume snap to allow for the storage drivers to talk tot he storage array, as these certificates are likely owned by the organization managing the cloud.\n\nThe *_cert_path options should actually be chosen by the snap or charm and the certificates should simply be provided. The certificates should be provided via a Juju secret, which allows for rotation as necessary.",
