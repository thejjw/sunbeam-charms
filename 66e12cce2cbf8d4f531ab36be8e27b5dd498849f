Like that, if any new region is added, it is propagated and does not rely on a \u003c\u003ccorrect\u003e\u003e sequence of action from the sunbeam cli.\n\nThe main goal of charms is to simplify operations. The sunbeam cli is an \u003c\u003corchestrator\u003e\u003e, but we should minimize actions / ad hoc operations as much as we can.",
