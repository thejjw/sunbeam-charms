description: |
  Principal charm that deploys ovn-northd, the OVN central control daemon,
  and ovsdb-server, the Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB).

  The ovn-northd daemon is responsible for translating the high-level OVN
  configuration into logical configuration consumable by daemons such as
  ovn-controller.

  The ovn-northd process talks to OVN Northbound- and Southbound- databases.

  The ovsdb-server exposes endpoints over relations implemented by the ovsdb
  interface.

  The charm supports clustering of the OVSDB, you must have a odd number of
  units for this to work. Note that write performance decreases as you
  increase the number of units.

  Running multiple ovn-northd daemons is supported and they will operate in
  active/passive mode. The daemon uses a locking feature in the OVSDB to
  automatically choose a single active instance.
