summary: Open Virtual Network for Open vSwitch
description: |
  Principal charm that deploys ovn-northd, the OVN central control daemon,
  and ovsdb-server, the Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB).

  The ovn-northd daemon is responsible for translating the high-level OVN
  configuration into logical configuration consumable by daemons such as
  ovn-controller.

  The ovn-northd process talks to OVN Northbound- and Southbound- databases.

  The ovsdb-server exposes endpoints over relations implemented by the ovsdb
  interface.

  The charm supports clustering of the OVSDB, you must have a odd number of
  units for this to work. Note that write performance decreases as you
  increase the number of units.

  Running multiple ovn-northd daemons is supported and they will operate in
  active/passive mode. The daemon uses a locking feature in the OVSDB to
  automatically choose a single active instance.

      description: |
        Raft leader election timeout in seconds. The charm allows a value between
        1 and 60 seconds.
        .
        The Open vSwitch ovsdb-server default of 1 second may not be sufficient
        for a loaded cluster where the database server may be too busy serving
        requests to respond to elections in time.
        .
        Using a higher value will increase the time to discover a real failure,
        but you must weigh that against the risk of spurious leader flapping and
        the unwanted churn that entails.
        .
        NOTE: The ovsdb-server will refuse to decrease or increase the value of
        this timer more than 2x the current value. The charm will compensate for
        this and decrease / increase the timer in increments, but care should be
        taken to not decrease / increase the value too much in one operation.
    ovsdb-server-inactivity-probe:
      default: 60
      type: int
      description: |
        Maximum number of seconds of idle time on connection to client before
        sending an inactivity probe message.

        The Open vSwitch ovsdb-server default of 5 seconds may not be sufficient
        depending on type and load of the CMS you want to connect to OVN.
