summary: Masakari - Instances High Availability Service
description: |
  Masakari provides Instances High Availability Service for OpenStack clouds by
  automatically recovering failed Instances. Currently, Masakari can recover
  KVM-based Virtual Machine(VM)s from failure events such as VM process down,
  provisioning process down, and nova-compute host failure. Masakari also
  provides an API service to manage and control the automated rescue mechanism.
