        Memory to be reserved for host for SEV enabled compute
        hosts. This memory will be used for instances. The compute
        usage report deducts this memory from the available
        memory sent to the placement service.
    pci-device-specs:
      type: string
      description: |
        A list of device specs used to set the `pci.device_spec` option in
        nova.conf, which allows PCI passthrough of specific devices to VMs.

        Example applications: GPU processing, SR-IOV networking, etc.

        NOTE: For PCI passthrough to work IOMMU must be enabled on the machine
        deployed to. This can be accomplished by setting kernel parameters on
        capable machines in MAAS, tagging them and using these tags as
        constraints in the model.

        Examples:

        * specify the PF address, exposing all the corresponding VFs:
          [{"physical_network": "physnet1", "address": "0000:1b:00.0"}]
        * pick VFs individually:
          [{"physical_network": "physnet2", "address": "0000:1b:10.0"},
           {"physical_network": "physnet2", "address": "0000:1b:10.2}]
        * address wildcards:
          [{"physical_network": "physnet1", "address": "*:1b:10.*"},
           {"physical_network": "physnet1", "address": ":1b:}]
        * address regex patterns:
          [{"physical_network": "physnet1",
            "address":
              {"domain": ".*", "bus": "1b", "slot": "10", "function": "[0-4]"}}]
        * vendor and product id:
          [{"physical_network": "physnet1", "vendor_id": "8086", "product_id": "1563"}]
    dpdk-enabled:

      type: int
      description: |
        The number of cores allocated to OVS datapath processing. A dedicated

    dpdk-memory:
      default: 0
      type: int
      description: |
        The total amount of memory in MB to allocate from hugepages for OVS DPDK.
        The charm will distribute this memory across NUMA nodes based on the
        bridged network interfaces and then pass it to OVS using

      pci-excluded-devices:
        type: string
        description: |
          A list of PCI addresses that will be excluded from the Nova PCI device whitelist.
          The main purpose of this setting is to accommodate per-node exclusion lists.

          For example, let's say that the user whitelisted all Intel x550 devices and then
          excluded one out of 4 such interfaces:
              pci_device_specs = [{"vendor_id": "8086", "product_id": "1563"}]
              excluded_devices = ["0000:1b:00.1"]

          The updated device spec will contain the vendor/product and pci address of the remaining
          3 Intel x550 devies.

              [
                  {"vendor_id": "8086", "product_id": "1563", "address": "0000:19:00.0"},
                  {"vendor_id": "8086", "product_id": "1563", "address": "0000:19:00.1"},
                  {"vendor_id": "8086", "product_id": "1563", "address": "0000:1b:00.0"},
              ]

          A device spec that doesn't contain any excluded devices will not be modified.
      ovs-dpdk-ports:
        type: string
        description: |
          Comma separated list of interface names that will be used with DPDK.

          The interfaces will be bound to the DPDK-compatible driver (vfio-pci by default) and
          corresponding DPDK ports will be created in OVS. Any bridges and bonds that use
          those interfaces will be updated with the resulting DPDK ports, based on the
          MAAS/Netplan configuration.

          The NUMA nodes of those interfaces will be used to determine pinned CPUs
          and huge pages used by OVS.
