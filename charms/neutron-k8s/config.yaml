    type: boolean
  dns-domain:
    default: cloud.sunbeam.local.
    description: |
      Specifies the dns domain name that should be used for building instance
      hostnames. The value of 'openstacklocal' will cause
      the dhcp agents to broadcast the default domain of openstacklocal and
      will not enable internal cloud dns resolution. This value should end
      with a '.', e.g. 'cloud.example.org.'.

      The hostname or address of the admin endpoints that should be advertised

      The hostname or address of the internal endpoints that should be advertised

    description: |
      Space-delimited list of <physical_network>:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max> or
      <physical_network> specifying physical_network names usable for VLAN
      provider and tenant networks, as well as ranges of VLAN tags on each

  global-physnet-mtu:
    type: int
    default: 1500
    description: |
      MTU of the underlying physical network. Neutron uses this value to
      calculate MTU for all virtual network components. For flat and
      VLAN networks, neutron uses this value without modification. For
      overlay networks such as VXLAN, neutron automatically subtracts
      the overlay protocol overhead from this value.
  path-mtu:
    type: int
    default: 1500
    description: |
      Maximum size of an IP packet (MTU) that can traverse the
      underlying physical network infrastructure without fragmentation
      when using an overlay/tunnel protocol. This option allows
      specifying a physical network MTU value that differs from the
      default global-physnet-mtu value.
  physical-network-mtus:
     type: string
     default:
     description: |
      Space-delimited list of <physical_network>:<mtu> pairs specifying MTU for
      individual physical networks.
      .
      Use this if a subset of your flat or VLAN provider networks have a MTU
      that differ with what is set in global-physnet-mtu.
