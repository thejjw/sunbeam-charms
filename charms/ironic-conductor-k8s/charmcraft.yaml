    conductor-group:

      type: string
      description: |
        Key to limit the set of baremetal nodes managed by this ironic
        conductor.
    use-ipxe:
      default: true
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Use iPXE instead of PXE. This option will start an additional
        HTTP server with a root in /httpboot.
    ipxe-http-port:
      default: "8080"
      type: string
      description: |
        The port used for the HTTP server used to serve iPXE resources.
    max-tftp-block-size:
      default: 0
      type: int
      description: |
        Force TFTP server maximum block size. Setting this option to anything
        other than 0, will force the block size sent over TFTP to the value
        specified here. Valid range is 512-65535. By default, clients will
        negotiate the block size.

        Use this option if you're running ironic in a network with lower
        MTU. The value of this option should be 32 bits less than the MTU.
        If your MTU is 1450, the value for this option should be 1418.
    disable-secure-erase:
      default: false
      type: boolean
      description: |
        This will disable secure erase in Ironic, when releasing a node. An ATA
        Secure Erase will be attempted. If it's not supported, the disks will be
        shreaded by writting random data to them once, then overwriting that data
        with zeros.

        Enabling this option will preserve the data on disk after release (not
        recommended for production).
    hardware-enablement-options:
      default:
      type: string
      description: |
        Options passed to the managed service to set configuration keys that
        enable the use of specific hardware.
    provisioning-network:
      default: !!null ""
      type: string
      description: |
        The name or ID of the provisioning network. This network is used to deploy
        bare metal nodes. This option is mandatory to allow Neutron network interfaces.
    cleaning-network:
      default: !!null ""
      type: string
      description: |
        The name or ID of the cleaning network. This network is used to clean
        bare metal nodes after they have been released. This option is mandatory
        to allow Neutron network interfaces. The same network may be used for both
        cleaning and provisioning.
    enabled-network-interfaces:
      type: string
      default: "flat, neutron, noop"
      description: |
        Comma separated list of network interfaces to be enabled in the Ironic config.
        Valid options are:
          * flat
          * neutron
          * noop

        Note: When enabling "neutron", you will also have to set the provisioning-network
        and the cleaning-network options. The settings for these networks can be overwritten
        per node, but they need to be set globally for ironic to start. The "neutron" network
        interface is needed if you require additional enablement from a ml2 driver you may
        have enabled in your deployment, such as switch configuration.
    default-network-interface:
      type: string
      default: "flat"
      description: |
        The default network interface to use for nodes that do not explicitly set a network
        interface type. The default network interface specified here, must also exist in the
        list of enabled-network-interfaces.
    pxe-append-params:
      # kernel_append_params
      default: "nofb nomodeset vga=normal console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8"
      type: string
      description: |
        Kernel command line parameters to pass to the deployment kernel.
        Options must be space delimited and will be passed as is to the deployment image.
        Aside from regular linux kernel command line parameters, you can also configure
        the ironic python agent (IPA) from within the deployment image. See the IPA
        documentation for a list of command line parameters which can be passed via
        pxe_append_params.
    automated-cleaning:
      # automated_clean
      default: true
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Globally enables automated cleaning of nodes. This is run when setting a node to available
        state, or when deleting an instance. Cleaning will bring the node in a baseline
        state. You can safely disable this feature if all tenants of your OpenStack deployment
        are trusted, or if you have a single tenant.

        Note: Automated cleaning can be toggled on a per node basis, via node properties.
        Note: node cleaning may take a long time, especially if secure erase is enabled.
    enabled-hw-types:
      # enabled_hardware_types
      default: "ipmi"
      type: string
      description: |
        Comma separated list of hardware types to enable.
        Valid options are:
          * ipmi
          * redfish
          * idrac
          * fake (for testing purposes)
    use-ipmitool-retries:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        Use ipmitool to do the retries by passing relevant parameters. By default the option
        is set to false and in this case Ironic will do the retries by re-running ipmi commands.
    deploy-logs-collect:
      default: "on_failure"
      type: string
      description: |
        Defines the deployment-log collection behaviour.
        Valid options are:
          * on_failure (default): Retrieve deployment logs on deployment failure.
          * always: Always collect logs even if deployment seccedded.
          * never: Disable log collection
    deploy-logs-storage-backend:
      default: "local"
      type: string
      description: |
        Defines the location to store logs.
        Valid options are:
          * local (default): Store logs on local filesystem.
          * swift: Store logs on swift container.
    deploy-logs-local-path:
      default: "/var/log/ironic/deploy"
      type: string
      description: |
        Location of the directory to store logs on local filesystem.
        Used when deploy-logs-storage-backend is configured to "local".
    deploy-logs-swift-container:
      default: "ironic_deploy_logs_container"
      type: string
      description: |
        The name of the swift container to store logs.
        Used when deploy-logs-storage-backend is configured to "swift".
    deploy-logs-swift-days-to-expire:
      default: 30
      type: int
      description: |
        Number of days before a log object expires in swift.
    swift-temp-url-duration:
      default: 1200
      type: int
      description: |
        The length of time (in seconds) that the temporary URL will be valid
        for. Defaults to 20 minutes. If some deploys get a 401 response code
        when trying to download from the temporary URL, try raising this
        duration.

actions:
  set-temp-url-secret:
    description: |
      Set Temp-Url-Key in the service object storage account. This enables Ironic
      to use the "direct" deploy method. In order for this to work, both Glance
      and Ironic must use the same tenant in their respective configs.

      This action must be performed on the ironic-conductor leader, after the
      deployment is complete. Glance must either use Swift/RadosGW as a storage
      backend, or multi-backend must be enabled in Glance with Swift as one of
      the supported stores.
