# manila-k8s

## Description

manila-k8s is an operator to manage the Manila API and Scheduler
services on a Kubernetes based environment.

## Usage

### Deployment

manila-k8s is deployed using command below:

    juju deploy manila-k8s manila --trust

For instructions on how to build the charm and deploy / refresh it, check out
the [CONTRIBUTING.md][contributors-guide].

Now connect the manila operator to existing database, messaging,
keystone identity, and traefik operators:

    juju deploy mysql-router-k8s manila-mysql-router --trust
    juju relate manila-mysql-router:backend-database mysql:database
    juju relate manila-mysql-router:database manila:database
    juju relate rabbitmq:amqp manila:amqp
    juju relate keystone:identity-service manila:identity-service
    juju relate traefik:ingress manila:ingress-internal

### Configuration

This section covers common and/or important configuration options. See file
`config.yaml` for the full list of options, along with their descriptions and
default values. See the [Juju documentation][juju-docs-config-apps] for details

### Actions

This section covers Juju [actions][juju-docs-actions] supported by the charm.
Actions allow specific operations to be performed on a per-unit basis. To
display action descriptions run `juju actions manila`. If the charm is not
deployed then see file `actions.yaml`.
