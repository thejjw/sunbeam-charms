      type: boolean

        Controls whether to assign a trust to the cluster user or not. You will
        need to set it to True for clusters with volume_driver=cinder or
        registry_enabled=true in the underlying cluster template to work. This is
        a potential security risk since the trust gives instances OpenStack API
        access to the cluster's project. Note that this setting does not affect
        per-cluster trusts assigned to the Magnum service user.
