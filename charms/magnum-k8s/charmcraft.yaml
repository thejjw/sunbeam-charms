summary: OpenStack magnum service
description: |
  Magnum is an OpenStack project which offers container orchestration engines
  for deploying and managing containers as first class resources in OpenStack.
assumes:
  - k8s-api
  - juju >= 3.1

base: ubuntu@24.04
platforms:
  amd64:

config:
  options:
    cluster-user-trust:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        Controls whether to assign a trust to the cluster user or not. You will
        need to set it to True for clusters with volume_driver=cinder or
        registry_enabled=true in the underlying cluster template to work. This is
        a potential security risk since the trust gives instances OpenStack API
        access to the cluster's project. Note that this setting does not affect
        per-cluster trusts assigned to the Magnum service user.
    debug:
      default: false
      description: Enable debug logging.
      type: boolean
    region:
      default: RegionOne
      description: Name of the OpenStack region
      type: string
    kubeconfig:
      type: secret
      description: |
        Kubeconfig to connect to Cluster API management cluster.
        The value should be juju secret.
    helm_chart_repo:
      default: "''"
      type: string
      description: |
        The helm chart repository path that hosts the capi helm chart.

        In case of OCI registry, set the repo path to "''".
        Setting the option to "" will leave the magnum-capi-helm
        driver option empty and uses defaults from the driver.

    helm_chart_name:
      default: oci://ghcr.io/canonical/charts/openstack-ck8s-cluster
      type: string
      description: |
        Name of the helm chart to use from the repo specified.

        In case of OCI registry, set the registry path as helm_chart_name
    capi_api_resources:
      default: '{"K8sControlPlane": {"api_version": "controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta2", "plural_name": "ck8scontrolplanes"}, "OpenstackCluster": {"api_version": "infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1beta1"}}'
      type: string
      description: |
        Override api resources provided by magnum-capi-helm driver.
        Value should be a dictionary in string format

        Defaults to settings required to support canonical k8s
    allowed_network_drivers:
      default: cilium
      type: string
      description: |
        Comma separated list of allowed CNI that can be deployed on
        Workload clusters.
        Supported drivers for canonical k8s are cilium
