  cluster-user-trust:

      Controls whether to assign a trust to the cluster user or not. You will
      need to set it to True for clusters with volume_driver=cinder or
      registry_enabled=true in the underlying cluster template to work. This is
      a potential security risk since the trust gives instances OpenStack API
      access to the cluster's project. Note that this setting does not affect
      per-cluster trusts assigned to the Magnum service user.
