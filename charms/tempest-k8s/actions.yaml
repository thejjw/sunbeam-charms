    Run a set of tempest tests.

    Tests can be filtered using parameters: regex, exclude-regex, and test-list.
    These parameters are optional; if none are given, all tests will run.

    Provided parameters narrow down the tests that will run.
    For example, `regex="one two" exclude-regex=three test-list=list1`,
    will run tests that are:
    - found in test list "list1"
    - AND match regex "one" or "two"
    - AND don't match regex "three"
  params:
    regex:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        A list of regexes, whitespace separated, used to select tests from the list.
        Tests matching any of the regexes will be selected.

        If no value provided (the default), all tests will be selected.

        To run the equivalent of tempest smoke tests (`tempest run --smoke`),
        use `regex=smoke`.
    exclude-regex:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        A single regex to exclude tests.
        Any test that matches this regex will be excluded from the final list.
    serial:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: Run tests serially. By default, tests run in parallel.
    test-list:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: |
        Use a predefined test list. See `get-lists` for available test lists.

get-lists:
  description: List existing test lists, to be used with validate action.
