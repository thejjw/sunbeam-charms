summary: OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service
description: |
  The Glance project provides an image registration and discovery service
  and an image delivery service. These services are used in conjunction
  by Nova to deliver images from object stores, such as OpenStack's Swift
  service, to Nova's compute nodes.

      type: string
    ceph-osd-replication-count:
      default: 3
      type: int
      description: |
        This value dictates the number of replicas ceph must make of any
        object it stores within the cinder rbd pool. Of course, this only
        applies if using Ceph as a backend store. Note that once the cinder
        rbd pool has been created, changing this value will not have any
        effect (although it can be changed in ceph by manually configuring
        your ceph cluster).
    ceph-pool-weight:
      type: int
      default: 20
      description: |
        Defines a relative weighting of the pool as a percentage of the total
        amount of data in the Ceph cluster. This effectively weights the number
        of placement groups for the pool created to be appropriately portioned
        to the amount of data expected. For example, if the ephemeral volumes
        for the OpenStack compute instances are expected to take up 20% of the
        overall configuration then this value would be specified as 20. Note -
        it is important to choose an appropriate value for the pool weight as
        this directly affects the number of placement groups which will be
        created for the pool. The number of placement groups for a pool can
        only be increased, never decreased - so it is important to identify the
        percent of data that will likely reside in the pool.
    volume-backend-name:
      default: null
      type: string
      description: |
        Volume backend name for the backend. The default value is the
        application name in the Juju model, e.g. "cinder-ceph-mybackend"
        if it's deployed as `juju deploy cinder-ceph cinder-ceph-mybackend`.
        A common backend name can be set to multiple backends with the
        same characters so that those can be treated as a single virtual
        backend associated with a single volume type.
    backend-availability-zone:
      default: null
      type: string
      description: |
        Availability zone name of this volume backend. If set, it will
        override the default availability zone. Supported for Pike or
        newer releases.
    restrict-ceph-pools:
      default: false
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Optionally restrict Ceph key permissions to access pools as required.
    rbd-pool-name:
      default: null
      type: string
      description: |
        Optionally specify an existing rbd pool that cinder should map to.
    rbd-flatten-volume-from-snapshot:
      default: false
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Flatten volumes created from snapshots to remove dependency from
        volume to snapshot. Supported on Queens+
    rbd-mirroring-mode:
      type: string
      default: pool
      description: |
        The RBD mirroring mode used for the Ceph pool. This option is only used
        with 'replicated' pool type, as it's not supported for 'erasure-coded'
        pool type - valid values: 'pool' and 'image'
    pool-type:
      type: string
      default: replicated
      description: |
        Ceph pool type to use for storage - valid values include `replicated`
        and `erasure-coded`.
    ec-profile-name:
      type: string
      default: null
      description: |
        Name for the EC profile to be created for the EC pools. If not defined
        a profile name will be generated based on the name of the pool used by
        the application.
    ec-rbd-metadata-pool:
      type: string
      default: null
      description: |
        Name of the metadata pool to be created (for RBD use-cases). If not
        defined a metadata pool name will be generated based on the name of
        the data pool used by the application.  The metadata pool is always
        replicated, not erasure coded.
    ec-profile-k:
      type: int
      default: 1
      description: |
        Number of data chunks that will be used for EC data pool. K+M factors
        should never be greater than the number of available zones (or hosts)
        for balancing.
    ec-profile-m:
      type: int
      default: 2
      description: |
        Number of coding chunks that will be used for EC data pool. K+M factors
        should never be greater than the number of available zones (or hosts)
        for balancing.
    ec-profile-locality:
      type: int
      default: null
      description: |
        (lrc plugin - l) Group the coding and data chunks into sets of size l.
        For instance, for k=4 and m=2, when l=3 two groups of three are created.
        Each set can be recovered without reading chunks from another set. Note
        that using the lrc plugin does incur more raw storage usage than isa or
        jerasure in order to reduce the cost of recovery operations.
    ec-profile-crush-locality:
      type: string
      default: null
      description: |
        (lrc plugin) The type of the crush bucket in which each set of chunks
        defined by l will be stored. For instance, if it is set to rack, each
        group of l chunks will be placed in a different rack. It is used to
        create a CRUSH rule step such as step choose rack. If it is not set,
        no such grouping is done.
    ec-profile-durability-estimator:
      type: int
      default: null
      description: |
        (shec plugin - c) The number of parity chunks each of which includes
        each data chunk in its calculation range. The number is used as a
        durability estimator. For instance, if c=2, 2 OSDs can be down
        without losing data.
    ec-profile-helper-chunks:
      type: int
      default: null
      description: |

        recovery of a single chunk. d needs to be chosen such that
        k+1 <= d <= k+m-1. Larger the d, the better the savings.
    ec-profile-scalar-mds:
      type: string
      default: null
      description: |
        (clay plugin) specifies the plugin that is used as a building
        block in the layered construction. It can be one of jerasure,
        isa, shec (defaults to jerasure).

        plugins acceptable - jerasure, lrc, isa, shec, clay.
    ec-profile-technique:

      default: null
      description: |

        `reed_sol_van`, `cauchy` for isa and `single`, `multiple`
        for shec.
    ec-profile-device-class:
      type: string
      default: null
      description: |
        Device class from CRUSH map to use for placement groups for
        erasure profile - valid values: ssd, hdd or nvme (or leave
        unset to not use a device class).

        .
        NOTE: The ceph-osd charm sets a global default for this value (defaults
        to 'lz4' unless configured by the end user) which will be used unless
        specified for individual pools.

        original size must be at least this small in order to store the
        compressed version on pools requested by this charm.
