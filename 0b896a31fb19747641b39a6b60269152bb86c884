      "message": "In testing, the cron daemon didn\u0027t in fact pass the environment variables through to the jobs.  So here I\u0027ve set it to notify back to pebble to start the actual command.  The charm will configure this service in pebble with the correct environment.\n\nThis is regardless probably a good pattern to follow, because it lets us more naturally transition to `pebble notify` when support for it is released in juju and ops.  Pebble notify will be better, because we can run the tempest tests from the charm in the same way as running the ad-hoc validate check, and allow for things like updating the charm status to show that periodic tests are in progress.",
