      "message": "It was a pain testing this due to bugs on the Observability side ([1], [2], [3]), but I finally managed to get the dashboard and alert rule showing in Grafana.

Please update the commit message as Samuel pointed out and I will be ready to give my +1.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/canonical/grafana-k8s-operator/issues/302\n[2]: https://github.com/canonical/grafana-k8s-operator/issues/303\n[3]: https://github.com/canonical/grafana-agent-k8s-operator/issues/275",
